\newcommand{\fakecite}{}

In this project I will endeavour to create a self-interpreter for (a subset of)
the reversible flowchart language RL{\fakecite}.

Like other self-interpreters for reversible languages such as Janus{\fakecite},
by virtue of being written in a reversible language, this interpreter will
itself be invertible, allowing the creation of a
\emph{non-standard interpreter towers}{\fakecite},
such that we get an inverse self-interpreter "for free".
I will experiment with such towers to see e.g. the performance impact of
different combinations of interpreters.

If time permits, I would also like to experiment with the interactions between
the self-interpreter and partial evaluation of the RL language{\fakecite}.
In particular, by the first Futamura Projection{\fakecite}, it should be
possible to "compile" RL programs to other RL programs. While this in itself
does not seem very useful, the generated target programs might give insight
into both the interpreter and partial evaluator.
